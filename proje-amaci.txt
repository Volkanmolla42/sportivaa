Sportiva: Comprehensive Project Plan
1. Executive Summary
sportiva is a digital platform designed to bring together gym owners, trainers, and members in a unified ecosystem. The platform allows users to have multiple roles (member, trainer, gym manager) with member being the default role. This solution addresses the digital transformation needs in the fitness industry by streamlining membership management, trainer-member interactions, appointment scheduling, and fitness history tracking.
Core Value Propositions:

For Members: Single access point to fitness history across gyms, easy appointment booking, current gym information
For Trainers: Expanded member reach, schedule management, professional profile management
For Gym Managers: Streamlined member and trainer management, digital record-keeping, operational efficiency

2. Product Vision & Strategy
Platform Overview
sportiva will be a web-based application with a focus on user experience and seamless integration of different roles. The system will use role-based access control to manage permissions while allowing users to switch between roles (member, trainer, gym manager) as needed.
Target Audience

Individual fitness enthusiasts
Professional and part-time trainers
Gym owners and managers

Key Differentiators

Multi-role support within a single user account
Cross-gym visibility of fitness history
Transparent approval mechanisms for gym-user relationships
Focus on data privacy and user consent

3. Technical Architecture
